Configure simulation.py
    * What is the distribution of number of turns taken?
    * Visualize oscillation in card advantage
        - This is continuous.  Abs(playerA.get_controlled() - playerB.get_controlled()) will show how much either
        player is winning by, without showing us which player is winning.  This may be easier for plotting.  This
        quantity will reach 52 when the game is over, which may be a natural stopping criteria for the loop shown
        in basic_run.py

Possibilities:
    * Does simulation timing change if we add in additional rules?  Is the exception taking longer than
    completed games would?
    * Test different methods of breaking indeterminate games
